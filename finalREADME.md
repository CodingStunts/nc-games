LINK TO HOSTED VERSION OF REACT APP

Hello and welcome to my project page! This React project forms the front end element of my portfolio piece which is accompanied by a backend server made using Express and node.js. React is the framework used for this project, for more information on the backend portion, please look at the nc-games-backend repo also on this github account.

The purpose of this React web app is to allow users to retrieve game review information including reviews, user data, comments, and category lists. It allows reviews to be sorted and ordered by several different criteria, whilst also having defaulted criteria in place. You can also post and amend the data in the comments, including upvoting, as well as deleting comments. Please feel free to have a mess around with it to see for yourself!
